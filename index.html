							this haunting world, Jake falls in love with Sadie, a beautiful

							On 22<sup>nd</sup> November 1963, John F. Kennedy's presidential
							motorcade rode through Dealey Plaza. He and his wife Jackie
							greeted the crowds on a glorious Friday afternoon in Dallas,
							Texas. Mitch Newman is a photojournalist based out of Washington,
							D.C. His phone never rings. When it does, a voice he hasn't heard
							in years will tell him his former fiancÃ©e Jean has taken her own
							life. Jean was an investigative reporter working the case of a
							lifetime. Somewhere in the shreds of her investigation is the
							truth behind her murder. For Mitch, piecing together the clues
							will become a dangerous obsession: one that will lead him to the
							dark heart of his country - and into the crossfire of a
